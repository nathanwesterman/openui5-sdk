Fortunately, OpenUI5 controls like the sap.m.Table already deliver a lot of features that we can use, and we can also configure the visibility of controls based on the device that we run the application on. With this, we have built a fully flexible app that will look great on many devices.">Step 35: Responsiveness and Device Adaptation</a><br/>
